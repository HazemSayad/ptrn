# ptrn
Pattern Shell script that will create a repeated pattern to a file based on inputs


## Usage

`./ptrn.sh <inputFile> <outFile> "string"`
1. `<inputfile>`: this is the inpute file that will count the number of lines and create a matching number of lines in output file
2. `<outputfile>`: this is the name of the output file that the script will write the pattern to
3. `"string"`: this is the string that will be patterned in the output file

## Roadmap
I will make it more flexible, useful and dynamic with bunch of cool features, but i am a linux noob and i am learning so this *might* take sometime
